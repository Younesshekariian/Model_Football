Working on data in machine learning and statistics:
A model for predicting soccer results working on historical soccer data
A prediction model based on random forest algorithm
There is a university project and research on data using the Pandas library, which includes two parts, one with the tkinter library, creating a small user interface for using the football dataset.

A football prediction model of football data based on classification and creation of random forest algorithm and interlaced matrix with sklearn libraries and pandas library. This is an academic project and the principle of concept to show the efficiency of pandas library in data science and machine learning.

This csv file discusses football data and this file is used in the prediction model 
It has the following columns
HomeTeam : The host team of the match
AwayTeam :	The guest team of the match
Winner : The winning team in the match
Player : The name of the player who scored a goal in the game
GoalTime : Minutes scored in the match
