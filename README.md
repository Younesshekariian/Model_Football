Working on data in machine learning and statistics:
A model for predicting soccer results working on historical soccer data
A prediction model based on random forest algorithm
There is a university project and research on data using the Pandas library, which includes two parts, one with the tkinter library, creating a small user interface for using the football dataset.

A football prediction model of football data based on classification and creation of random forest algorithm and interlaced matrix with sklearn libraries and pandas library. This is an academic project and the principle of concept to show the efficiency of pandas library in data science and machine learning.
